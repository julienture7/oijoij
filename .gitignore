# Bun - bun.lockb is the binary lockfile.
# bun.lock (the text file) SHOULD be committed.
# If you see a .bun-debug or similar, add it too.
# For now, we'll assume bun.lock is the one you want to keep.

# Local environment variables
# IMPORTANT: Never commit your actual .env files with secrets!

# Temporary/Generated files from your listing
# If 'output.txt' and 'structure.txt' are not meant to be part of the repository,
# keep them here. If they are important files you want to track, remove them from this .gitignore.

# Other common Next.js ignores
# next-env.d.ts is usually generated and can be ignored,
# but many prefer to commit it for explicitness, especially if customized.
# If you don't customize it and it's always generated, you can add:
# next-env.d.ts
